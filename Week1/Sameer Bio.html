    <h1>Ahmad Sameer Ahmadi</h1>
    <p>
        I was born in 2002 in Afghanistan during a time of significant change. Growing up in a war-torn country, 
        I developed a strong interest in technology, inspired by its ability to solve problems and connect people.

        After losing my only parent to COVID-19 and fleeing Afghanistan in 2021 due to the return of the Taliban, 
        I resettled in Canada with my siblings. Starting over in a new country was challenging, but it gave me hope and an opportunity to pursue my dreams.
